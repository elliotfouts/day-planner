# Day Planner
A calendar that allows users to plan out their day by scheduling activities into color coordinate input fields. The tasks are autosaved each time the user types and are stored in local storage. I used moment.js to gather the time information and used jQuery for DOM manipulations. 

#### Technologies Used
* jQuery (keyup, .each)
* local storage
* moment.js
